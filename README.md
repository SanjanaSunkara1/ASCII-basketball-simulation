# 🏀 ASCII Basketball Simulation 🏀

#### 🎥 Video Demo: <https://youtu.be/Pay7y-4YGUg>

#### 📋 Description:

**ASCII Basketball Simulation** is a fun, interactive terminal-based basketball game built in Python! Using just your keyboard, you line up shots by entering an **angle (1–90°)** and **power (1–30)** — then watch your shot fly across an ASCII basketball court with realistic projectile motion physics.

Each shot is unique; the hoop 🏀 moves to a new random location after every attempt, so you’ll need to adjust your aim and power each time. You’ve got **10 seconds per input** and **5 total shots**, so get ready to beat the buzzer! ⏱️

Score **3 or more baskets**, and you’ll hear a celebratory sound and see a trophy message. 🎉

### ✨ Features:

-  Ball animation using real physics (sine, cosine, gravity)
-  Randomized hoop placement after every shot
-  Timed inputs to keep gameplay exciting
-  Real-time score and shot tracking
-  Fully ASCII-rendered basketball court and ball
-  Unit tested using **pytest** for key functions like scoring and trajectory

This game is built using **Python standard libraries only** (plus `pytest` for testing). It’s my final project for **Harvard CS50P (Introduction to Programming with Python)** — combining my love for basketball and programming. 👩‍💻+🏀
